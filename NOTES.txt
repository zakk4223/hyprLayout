For ease of writing common layouts, the server handles the following things:
  - Gaps and border sizes. Layouts should just place windows assuming no gaps.
  - Fullscreen window requests, both true and 'maximized'. Layouts will receive requests when a window goes fullscreen
    and when it exits
  - Generic 'visual' focus movement.
  - Generic 'visual' window movement.
  - Flagging windows as part of a 'master' stack. This includes common layoutmsgs for adding/swapping/removing masters
  - Drag and drop
  - Resizing windows via mouse or keyboard commands
  - flagging windows as 'pseudotiled' (TODO)
  - The server maintains the order of windows. Clients can modify this when they push window info for a layout.
